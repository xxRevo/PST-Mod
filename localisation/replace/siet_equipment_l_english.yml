 SOV_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "After trials of several different repeating bolt action designs Russia adopted a new standard infantry rifle in 1891. It fires the 7.62x54r cartridge and is a combination of designs by Russian Sergei Mosin and Belgian Leon Nagant whose primary contribution was the magazine and feed system. The official Russian designation is “Three Line Rifle, Model of the Year 1891” but is more commonly known in the US as the Mosin Nagant M91. A “line” is a unit of measure equal to 1/10th of an inch. Production of the M91 took place at the Russian arsenals at Izhevsk, Tula, and Sestroryetsk. M91s were widely used in WWI."

 SOV_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "In 1930 "new" rifle was designated the "7,62 mm Rifle, Model of the Year 1891-30", more commonly known in the US as the M91/30. Changes included the front and rear sights and split barrel bands, receivers were replaced. Many rifles dated prior to 1930 are found in M91/30 configuration but retain the original markings on the barrel shank with dates prior to 1930. This is from programs, primarily post WWII, to update older rifles by the Soviets. Primary production ended in 1944 with few examples, mostly snipers, dated later. M91/30s were used as the basis for sniper rifles from the mid-'30s with several types of mounts and scopes."

 SOV_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "PPSh-41 is a Soviet magazine-fed selective fire submachine gun designed by Georgi Shpagin as a cheap, simplified alternative to the PPD-40. Made largely of stamped steel, it can be loaded with either a box or drum magazine, and fires the 7.62×25mm Tokarev pistol round. The impetus for the development of the PPSh came partly from the Winter War against Finland, where the Finnish Army employed the Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun as a highly effective tool for close-quarter fighting. The PPSh saw extensive combat use during World War II and the Korean War. It was one of the major infantry weapons of the Soviet Armed Forces during World War II."

 SOV_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "Production of the SVT-38 was terminated in April 1940 and an improved design, the SVT-40, entered production. It was a more refined, lighter design with a modified magazine release. The handguard was now single-piece and the cleaning rod was housed under the barrel. Other changes were made to simplify manufacture. Production of this improved rifle began in July 1940 at Tula, and later at factories in Izhevsk and Podolsk. The SVT-40 was more often issued to non-commissioned officers and elite units like the Naval Infantry. Since these factories already had experience manufacturing the SVT-38, 70,000 SVT-40s were produced in 1940."

The ZiS-5 could carry a single passenger in the cab with up to 20 men in the rear flatbed. Most notably, the ZiS-5 was used to carry the BM-8 Katyusha rocket launcher. The total length of ZiS-5 was around six meters with a total weight of 3.1 ton unloaded. The armament of the ZiS was generally nothing but the weapons the soldiers carried on them but sometimes, heavy machine gun was mounted on the rear flatbed."

The BTR-40's development began in early 1947 at the design bureau of the Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod (Gorkovsky Automobile Factory). The concept was a successor to the BA-64B armoured car which went out of production in 1946. The BTR-40's design was based on the GAZ-63 four wheel drive truck. The BTR-40's armour is from 6 mm to 8 mm thick which gives it protection from small arms fire."

Rocket artillery deliver explosives to a target area more quickly than conventional artillery, but with lower accuracy and requiring a longer time to reload. They are fragile compared to artillery guns, but are inexpensive and easy to produce. Katyushas were usually mounted on trucks. This mobility gave the Katyusha another advantage: being able to deliver a large blow all at once, and then move before being attacked with counter-battery fire."

It was a development of the British Vickers 6-Ton tank and was one of the most successful tank designs of the 1930s until its light armour became vulnerable to newer anti-tank guns. It was produced in greater numbers than any other tank of the period, with more than 11000 manufactured. During the 1930s, the USSR developed 53 variants of the T-26.

Although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war, it has been credited as the most efficient and influential tank design of the war. The T-34 possessed an unprecedented combination of firepower, mobility, protection and ruggedness. Its 76.2 mm gun provided a substantial increase in firepower over any of its contemporaries; its heavy sloped armour was difficult to penetrate by most anti-tank weapons. When first encountered in 1941, the German tank general von Kleist called it "the finest tank in the world"."

 SOV_modern_tank_aa_equipment_1_desc:0 "The ZSU-57-2 (Object 500) is a Soviet self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG), armed with 2 57 mm autocannons. 'ZSU' stands for Zenitnaya Samokhodnaya Ustanovka, meaning "anti-aircraft self-propelled mount". It was the first Soviet mass-produced tracked SPAAG. In the USSR it had the unofficial nickname "Sparka", meaning "pair", referring to the twin autocannon with which the vehicle is armed. Soviet engineers designed a vehicle that used a modified T-54 chassis, with four twin road wheels per side instead of five, and much thinner armour."
